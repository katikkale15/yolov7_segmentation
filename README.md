Segmentation is a very helpful aspect of the yolo, as it particularly masks only the portion of the detected object.

This type of system is specifically used in ADAS and other detection algorithms and tracking algorithms for accurate tracking. This can also be used for target locking if the object is too up-close which will decrease the area of error.


By decreasing the area of error, it means that it will only mask the said "tracked" object which will be easier to capture or destroy, based on the application.

This image shows the exact masking of humans and other objects detected in the frame like the backpack.

In the notebook, towards the end, there is a video that displays the best use of the segmentation.
